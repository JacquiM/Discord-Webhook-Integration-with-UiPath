# Discord Webhook Integration with UiPath
The Discord Integration takes multiple different forms:
* UiPath Library
* Nuget Package
* UiPath Integration Services Connector

Each of these interact with the Discord API which allows for the posting of messages to channels on a Discord through the use of a webhook. When creating a webhook on Discord, associated to a channel, an ID and token are provided in the URL to make the endpoint unique.
